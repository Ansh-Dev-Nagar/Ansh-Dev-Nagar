### Hi there, I'm @Ansh-Dev-Nagar ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about building **scalable web applications**, solving **complex problems**, and I enjoy **competitive coding**.

I specialize in both front-end and back-end development using modern web technologies.

I have done my **B.Tech in Information Technology** from **Manipal University Jaipur**.

I have built multiple **full-stack applications**, demonstrating my ability to develop **scalable and robust** solutions. Some of my notable projects include:  
- [**PingMe**](https://github.com/Ansh-Dev-Nagar/PingMe-ChatApplication) â€“ A **real-time chat application** with **Socket.io** for instant messaging and **JWT authentication** for secure logins.  
- [**Adventure Point**](https://github.com/Ansh-Dev-Nagar/Adventure_Point) â€“ A **full-stack web app** designed to discover, share, and review adventure destinations.
. 
 
And many more **projects**, showcasing my expertise in **Modern Technologies**.
